        <h1> By using CSS I'll change certain parts of this text to a different color </h1>
        <p>
            Much of this is regular text, but some of it is <span>fancy</span>!
            We can use our <span>newly fancified font</span> to add some
            <span>flair</span> to our website. It'd be a <span>royal pain</span>
            to make each of these span tags <span>fancy</span> individually,
            but it's a cinch with <span>CSS</span>!
