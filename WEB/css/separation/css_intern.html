    <h1> By using CSS I'll change certain parts of this text to a different color </h1>
    <p>
        Much of this is regular text, but some of it is <span>fancy</span>!
        We can use our <span>newly fancified font</span> to add some
        <span>flair</span> to our website. It'd be a <span>royal pain</span>
        to make each of these span tags <span>fancy</span> individually,
        but it's a cinch with <span>CSS</span>!
