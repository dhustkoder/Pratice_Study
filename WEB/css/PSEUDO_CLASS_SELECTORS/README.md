#Pseudo-Class Selectors

A pseudo-class selector is a way of accessing html
items that aren't part of the document tree.

For instance, it's very easy to see where a link is in
the tree. But where would you find information about
whether a link had been clicked on or not?
it isn't there.

Pseudo-class selectors let us style these kind of 
changes in our html file.

Using pseudo selectors, you can control the appearance
of unvisited and visited sections. You can change
the appearance of a element that the user is 
hovering his cursor for example.
