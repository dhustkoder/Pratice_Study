# What is CSS ?

CSS ( Cascading Style Sheets ) is a language used to describe the appearance of your HTML elements

A STYLE SHEET is a file that describes how an HTML file should look.


We say style sheets are cascading because the sheets can apply formatting when more than one style applies. For instance if you say all paragraphs should have blue front, but specifically single one to have red font, CSS can do that.
