# CSS & HTML & EM

The font-size unit "em" is a relative measure: 1em is equal to the default font size on
whatever screen the user is using. That makes it great for phones screen.
since it does not force sizes to the phone screen. it just scale:
1em is the default size that the user screen uses for that element/font
2em is twice the default size... goes on
as 0.5 is half the default size.
