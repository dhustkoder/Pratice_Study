HTML elements can be CSS selectors, there are 2 important selectors, I have showed 'id' now I'll do 
classes (not like in OOP haha).

1. Classes are useful when you have a bunch of elements that should all receive the same styling. Rather than applying the same rules to several selectors, you can simply apply the same class to all those HTML elements, then define the styling for that class in the CSS tab. Classes are identified in CSS with a dot (.) before the class name



2. IDs are grear for when you have exactly one element that should receive a certain kind of styling.  IDs are assigned to HTML elements the word id and an equals sign. IDs are identified in CSS with a pound sign (#)
