/*
    Association is a relationship where all objects have their own 
    lifecycle and there is no owner. Letâ€™s take an example of Teacher and Student. 
    Multiple students can associate with single teacher and single student can associate with multiple teachers, 
    but there is no ownership between the objects and both have their own lifecycle. 
    Both can create and delete independently.

// but if we delete the Departament , the Teacher will not be deleted. this is a "Has-a" relationship
