	// When users of a complex system are ignorant of how it works, yet

	// By measure , template type deduction in C++ is a tremendous success
	// Millions of programmers have passed arguments to template functions with completely
	// satisfactory results, even though many of those programmers would be hard pressed
	// to give more than the haziest desciption of how the types used by those functions were deduced

	// type deduction for templates is the basis for one of modern C++'s most compelling
	// features: auto. 


	// Too bad that when the template type deduction rules are applied in the context of auto,
	// they sometimes seem less intuitive than when they're applied to templates.


	// For that reason It's really important to truly understand the aspects of template type deduction that auto builds on.
