#Code Reuse
## Composition Vs Inheritance


One of the most compelling features of C++ and other a-like languages (OOP too), is Code Reuse.


The Trick is to use classes without soiling existing code.



###Composition:
#### You simple create an object of an existing class, into your new class.




###Inheritance:
####As We know you create a new class with the type of an existing class, automaticaly inheriting all the base class's public members Interface/Implementation/data and the protected members Implementation/data. the major work of Inheritance is made by the compiler.
